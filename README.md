Youkai Enemies mod for Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead

# Goals of this mod:
The main aim of this mod is to add a new enemy faction, the youkai, demons from our world, alongside their subfactions. They were awaken from their semi-slumber by the coming of otherwordly intruders and are now as dangerous to them as they are to you.  They will be based mostly on Japanese folklore, atleast for now. My main inspiration is the Shin Megami Tensei series of games (although I am trying to follow historical depictions more-so in terms of looks), and because of it demons from other cultures might be added later also.
