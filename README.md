Youkai Enemies mod for Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead

# Goals of this mod:
*Awoken from their slumber, the demons of this world rage. Sensing the passage of otherwordly intruders, they have come to defend their territory. What they saw was as dangerous to them as they are to you.*

The main aim of this mod is to add a new enemy faction, the Youkai, demons from our world, along with their subfactions. 
They will be based mostly on Japanese folklore, at least for now. My main inspiration is the *Shin Megami Tensei* series of games (although I am trying to follow historical depictions more-so in terms of looks), and because of it demons from other cultures might be added later also.
